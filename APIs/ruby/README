 This folder contains a Makefile to build a Ruby API for FreeLing using SWIG.

 However, SWIG supports ruby only partially, thus the Makefile contains a series of hacks that may need adjusting.

 Please read carefully the comments in the Makefile and perform the required adjustments before running it.
